A Budgeting and Personal Finance App developped

This application's server was developped in a localhost server with XAMPP, using php and mysql(for the database).
To make it runable you need to download and install XMAPP and copy the content of mine XMAPP folder (It's in server side folder)

The application itself is writen in Web language (HTML, Javascript, PHP, CSS), to make it a real app I've used Cordova.

As the server is in localhost, to be able to use the Database it's mandatory that the Smartphone and the server are in the same network.


This project was in collaboration with other student, I made the backend and he made the frontend.
I have got some problems trying to make it online because all free hosting websites prohibites other requests than GET&POST.
